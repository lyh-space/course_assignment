# Course_assignment
Here are some homework of some courses during my undergraduate study, mainly programming homework.

Due to copyright and other reasons, there are only my own homework here, which does not include the standard answers given by teachers and teaching assistants. I don't guarantee the correctness of these assignments, for reference only.
